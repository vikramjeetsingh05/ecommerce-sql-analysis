### 1. Monthly Revenue Trend

Revenue started at a relatively low level in September 2023 (₹151,136) and increased sharply in October 2023 (₹262,503), indicating strong early growth. From November 2023 to August 2025, revenue remained largely stable within the range of ₹210,000 to ₹265,000, suggesting consistent business performance over this period.

The highest revenue was recorded in December 2024 (₹278,154), indicating strong year-end sales. In contrast, September 2025 showed a significant decline (₹91,848), which may be due to incomplete data or reduced customer activity.
